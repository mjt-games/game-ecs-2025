# [MJT Games](https://github.com/mjt-games) Game ECS 2025

A modern/modular/open/modable game runtime using proven game system paradigms.

# Conceptual Inspirations
- [Paradox Interactive](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com)'s [Clausewitz Engine](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Scripting) 
- [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org)

# Elevator Pitch

Most computer games are the same under the hood. There are universals like Entities, and Systems for evolving the game state over time represented by ticks. Games are content driven. Unlike a book/song/movie the content is both data AND interactions (code). If one were able to create a reasonable standard for how to serialize game content that includes the systems (code), then creators/players will have the ability to remix content to create new games.

# Objectives
- Open: Creativity wants to be free.
- Stable: Content wants to last the test of time.
- Modular: Parts so that we can take the good parts, and leave the rest.
- Simple


# Non-Objectives
- Difficult: The easiest way to do something is the right way.
